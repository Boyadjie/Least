# Least
This project is a test of react native for a school project named Least.

## How to start

I've choose to use expo to have a live visualisation of the app on my phone so you'll need to install expo-go on your device.

When you have fork the repo you can run :
```
npm install
```
to install all the dependencies.

Then you can run :
```
npm start
```
to start the server.

If the wireless connexion on the same internet connexion work for you, you can use it. Or just plug your phone to you computer will work to if you allow the debugging.
You can now choose on which device you want to run your app.

Now you can have fun !
